# NFT Metadata

It's a laborious process to obtain NFT metadata. This repository aims to collect most prominent collections within itself for easy access.

Collections are by **chain**. They are identified by their contract address on that chain. Each collection corresponds to one `.json` file stored with Git LFS.
